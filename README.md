# Slices for the movie

I am creating a movie that shows the evolution of both the density fluctuations and magnetic fields as a function of redshift in our simulations. 

This code just shows the line evolution of the fields as a function of redshift at each timestamp, while showing the maximum value of the each field at each chekpoint.

## Showing the maximum:
