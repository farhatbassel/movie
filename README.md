# Thesis Plots

# 1) Slices

I am creating a slice plot of what is happening in the simulation at a certain redshift.

### Magnetic Field:

# 2) Line Plots
I am creating a movie that shows the evolution of both the density fluctuations and magnetic fields as a function of redshift in our simulations. 

This code just shows the line evolution of the fields as a function of redshift at each timestamp, while showing the maximum value of the each field at each chekpoint.

### Showing the rms value:
